## ✨ Key Features
- **Task Creation:** Add tasks instantly via the "Add" button or by pressing the `Enter` key.
- **Task Deletion:** Remove specific tasks from the DOM with a single click.
- **Completion Toggle:** Click on any task text to visually mark it as completed (strike-through effect).
- **Input Validation:** Prevents the addition of empty tasks using string trimming and alerts.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean, mobile-friendly design using CSS Flexbox.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **CSS Transitions:** Smooth hover effects and state changes for a better user experience (UX).
